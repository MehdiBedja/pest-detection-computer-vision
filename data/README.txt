# ðŸ“‚ Data Overview

This folder provides **links and documentation** for all datasets used in this project.  
Since the datasets are large, they are hosted on **Kaggle** for easy access.

The project experiments were based on **IP102**, a large-scale agricultural pest dataset.  
From this, a **filtered subset of 13 pest classes** was created and preprocessed for different object detection models (YOLO & Faster R-CNN).

## âœ… 2. Filtered Dataset: 13 Selected Pest Classes
- **Description:**  
  A **cleaned & filtered subset** of the IP102 dataset containing **only 13 agriculturally important pest classes**.  
  Images were selected based on quality, relevance, and class balance.
